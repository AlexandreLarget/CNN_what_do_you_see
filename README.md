# CNN CNN what do you see ?

Neural networks are always refered to black-box because it is hard to understand individually each neuron's work and how they interact together.
Here we gonna open this black-box and give some visual explanations to understand how a convolutional neural network is able to "see" things.
To do so, we will work on maybe the most popular convolutional neural network (CNN), the VGG16. Despite its gae, it was first introduced in 2014[^1], it is still used in many cases and applications and keep producing mazing results compared to newer architectures.
