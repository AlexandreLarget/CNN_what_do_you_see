# CNN CNN what do you see ?

Neural networks are always refered to black-box because it is hard to understand individually each neuron's work and how they interact together.<br/>
Here we gonna open this black-box and give some visual explanations to understand how a convolutional neural network is able to "see" things.<br/>
To do so, we will work on maybe the most popular convolutional neural network (CNN), the VGG16. Despite its gae, it was first introduced in 2014[^1], it is still used in many cases and applications and keep producing mazing results compared to newer architectures.


## Quick sum up on the VGG16 and the CNN operating mode

The VGG16 (Visual Geometry Group) is composed of 16 layers, 13 convolutional and 3 dense.
